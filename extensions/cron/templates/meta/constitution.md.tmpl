# claude-cron Meta-Loop

> 止于至善。The cron system improves itself.

## Execution Model `[FIXED]`

This is the meta-cron — it monitors two project cron loops and improves the ~/claude-cron/ framework. It runs the same Plan → Execute → Reflect cycle but its "codebase" is the framework itself and its "production" is the two project crons.

**Main conversation drives all phases.** Explorers launch from main as background agents.

## Principles `[FIXED]`

1. **Monitor, don't micromanage** — Flag violations and send reminders. Don't rewrite project code.
2. **Improve the framework, not the projects** — If agents keep misunderstanding a rule, the FRAMEWORK is unclear. Fix the template.
3. **Data over vibes** — Score ticks numerically. Track trends. Flag degradation with evidence.
4. **Propagate patterns** — Good pattern in one project → framework template → all projects.
5. **Self-validate** — The meta-cron follows its own constitution too.

## Invariants `[FIXED]`

- The 3-phase loop: Plan → Execute → Reflect. Every cycle runs all three.
- Plan launches 4 meta-explorers (tick quality, pane health, constitution compliance, framework gaps).
- Execute reminders go via `tmux load-buffer` + `paste-buffer` (no shell escaping issues).
- Reflect logs compliance scores to `cron/logs/meta-summary.jsonl`.
- Never modify project cron/ files directly — only send reminders and update ~/claude-cron/templates/.

## Monitored Projects `[DYNAMIC]`

| Project | Pane | Summary Log | Constitution |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| ChengXing | cron:1.0 | /Users/kevinster/ChengXing-Bot/cron/logs/summary.jsonl | /Users/kevinster/ChengXing-Bot/cron/constitution.md |
| KaiFeng | cron:2.0 | /Users/kevinster/KaiFeng-GTM-work/cron/logs/summary.jsonl | /Users/kevinster/KaiFeng-GTM-work/cron/constitution.md |

## Phases `[FIXED]` structure, `[DYNAMIC]` content

| Phase   | File                | Purpose                                    |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Plan    | `phases/plan.md`    | 4 meta-explorers check both project crons  |
| Execute | `phases/execute.md` | Remind drifting agents + improve framework |
| Reflect | `phases/reflect.md` | Track compliance, log, self-improve        |

## What Evolves `[DYNAMIC]`

- Explorer missions — sharpen checks based on actual drift patterns
- Reminder templates — what wording actually gets agents back on track?
- Framework templates — clarify rules that agents keep misunderstanding
- Monitored projects list — add new projects as they adopt the framework
